## ‚öôÔ∏è Functionalities

**People can register using:**

POST "/sign-up":<br/> 
{<br/>
 "name": (maximum 50 characters),<br/>
 "password": (minimun 4 characters)<br/>
}<br/>

**User can login using:**

POST "/sign-in" (example):
{
  "name":"test_prod",
  "password":"1234"
}

You will get a token for the authenticated routes.

**Anyone can see the matches registered:**

GET "/match":
You will get a array of objects like this:
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "team1": "Catar",
    "team2": "Equador",
    "goalsTeam1": null,
    "goalsTeam2": null,
    "matchDate": "2022-11-20T00:00:00.000Z"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "team1": "Inglaterra",
    "team2": "Ir√£",
    "goalsTeam1": null,
    "goalsTeam2": null,

  }
  ]
  
 **Anyone can see the ranking of users ranked by score:**
 
 GET "/ranking":
 You will get a array of objects like this:
[
  {

  }
]

 **Anyone can change the match result (I recommend only with correct results) using:**

PUT "match/result/:idMatch" (example):

{
  "goalsTeam1":3,
  "goalsTeam2":0
}

**Only logged users can guess using:**

POST "/guess/:idMatch" (example):
Remember to use a header with a valid token.

  "goalsTeam2":0
}

**Only logged users can delete your guess using:**

DELETE "/guess/:idMatch"
Remember to use a header with a valid token.
